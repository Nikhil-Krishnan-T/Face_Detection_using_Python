# Face Detection Using Python

The objective of the program given is to detect object of interest(face) in real time and to keep tracking of the same object. This is a simple example of how to detect face in Python. We can try to use training samples of any other object of our choice to be detected by training the classifier on required objects.

Face detection is used in biometrics, often as a part of (or together with) a facial recognition system. It is also used in video surveillance, human computer interface and image database management.

Face detection is the process of detecting faces, from an image or a video does not matter. The program does nothing more than finding the faces. But on the other hand in the task of face recognition, the program finds faces and can also tell which face belongs to which. So itâ€™s more informative than just detecting them. There is more programming, in other words, more training in the process.
